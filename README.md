Volunteering as the UMass Boston Baseball Analyst for the 2026 season and posted here is the work I am doing in RStudio. My goals for the 2026 season are to:

      - identify what statistics have the biggest impacts on predicted wins to help tailor team development
      - provide individual player analysis to highlight what players are doing 
          well and what they need to work on to contribute more to overall team success
      - help add to the information available for scouts and provide a more in depth prediction of opponent 
          situational pitching, how to pitch around the opponent's offense, and how to shift the defense to where 
          the offense is most likely going to put the ball in play
